# 🩺 DATA_VISUALIZATION_ASSIGNMENT_DIABETES_DATASET

This project focuses on performing data visualization and exploratory interpretation on the Diabetes dataset, commonly used for understanding medical risk factors and predicting diabetes progression. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, the notebook visually investigates feature distributions, correlations, and relationships between clinical variables.

Dataset: Diabetes Dataset (regression dataset from Scikit-learn)

# Overview:
This notebook demonstrates a structured approach to medical data visualization, including:

1. Distribution analysis of clinical features (BMI, BP, Age, etc.)

2. Correlation heatmap to identify strongly related features

3. Pairplots to observe multivariate interactions

4. Scatterplots showing relationships between features and disease progression

5. Boxplots to understand outliers and variation

6. Visual interpretation of factors influencing diabetes progression

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

1. Pandas

2. NumPy

3. Matplotlib

4. Seaborn

5. Scikit-learn (for loading dataset)

6. Google Colab
